# Capomulin- Tumor Impacts Summary



* Capomulin performed at or near the same level as the other top performing drug Ramicane bringing tumors to the low 40's(mm3)
which is approximate 10(mm3) smaller than the bulk of the other drugs in the study.

* Ramicane tumors were just slighly smaller, and they also showed a slightly greater consistency with lower variances, deviations, and errors of the mean

* However the subjects in the Capomulin study final timepoints were slightly longer, which suggests the life exptency is just as good, perhaps even better.  

*The differences in these two drugs would require more further examination, deeper study, or perhaps other variables that aren't exposed by this data to determine any significant differences, as they are very similar. 

* Mentioned adjacent to these two top performing drugs, Ramicane and Capomulin, respectively, one of the bulk lower perfoming drugs was a placebo.  7 drugs perfomed at approximately the same level as the placebo.
