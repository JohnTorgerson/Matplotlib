# Capomulin- Impacts on Tumors

We're looking at a study of various drug regimens on the tumors in mice with a focus on a new drug of interest: Capomulin

## Observation Summary

* Capomulin performed at or near the same level as the other top performing drug Ramicane bringing tumors to the low 40's(mm3)
which is approximate 10(mm3) smaller than the bulk of the other drugs in the study.

* Ramicane tumors were just slighly smaller, and they also showed a slightly greater consistency with lower variances, deviations, and errors of the mean. 

* Mentioned adjacent to these two top performing drugs, Ramicane and Capomulin, respectively, one of the bulk lower perfoming drugs was a placebo.  7 drugs perfomed at approximately the same level as the placebo. 



## Processes

* I started by looking at two data sets and combined them into one set.  After that I found that one of the test subjects had some duplicated results so that data was dropped from the analysis. 


* AFter that I began breaking the data down into some readable groups to look more closely at what the data was telling us. 


* Some of that I put into basic visualizations for perspective.


* Once that was done we wanted to look at the drugs of greatest interest which included Capomulin as well as 3 others.


* We next wanted to see how Capomulin and the other 3 drugs performed by looking at tumor volume over time.

* After manipulating and extacting that specific data I'd have drawn it into a series of four sub-boxplots sharing the same axis
and this is where I ran out of time.  Sorry.


 
## Team

* Andrew Sundquist had a more simplified method of decluttering unusable mouse(study subject) data
    also assisted me in manipulating data for boxplot exercise (specifically finding 'in enumerate')
    
    ** Unfortunately, I ran out of time and never got to utilize all the things I was working on with Andrew but I'm fairly certain we were on the right trackdf.
    
* Sanoo Singh helped me differentiate the two different graph methods .plot vs pyplot
